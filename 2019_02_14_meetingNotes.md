## Agenda scientific figures python club
Come up with a short description of one (or more!) specific python challenges/problems you would like to discuss with the group in a future meeting.

We can then use this to plan future meetings. Perhaps there is someone else in the group that has dealt with a particular issue before, and they or you can volunteer to lead a meeting on your problem.

## Meeting notes Feb 14 python club
- Thomas: reusable parameters for coding, reuseable things for code
- Eleanor: how to make a library how to import (Ryan seconds this)
- Jennifer: how to import many weird data files and combine them into a useable format. How to do this fast and how to speed up data importing?
- Jennifer: plotting spatial data
- Jennifer: how to write testable code
- Sage: Create yml files for making environments. Does that mean the library has to include an environment. How to define dependencies in libraries? Dealing with environments.
- Ryan: running a python script many times with different parameter combinations. What do we have available at UW? Strategies for parallelizing many different runs. How to access HPC? How to do AWS?
- accessing different files in different folders, creating plots and saving them somewhere

## Schedule for upcoming weeks
- Feb 21: plotting spatial data, and glob (Eleanor)
- Feb 28: config files for plotting, etc  (Thomas)
- March 7: importing data files of different formats and combining them (jennifer)
