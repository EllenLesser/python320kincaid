#This week's exercise is basically: Fix Tanvi's code  

I have added two data files (.csv) [here](http://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1vMRWL-QPh30T7fK17aJM7QgDpRJ74ocn) and the .ipy code into  the "python320kincaid\exercise_submissions\data\Tanvi's_code" folder. 

Try to identify all that is wrong with it (focusing on memory issues) but free to fix other things as well.

##You could try: 
1) Identifying the various variables in the workspace and how much memory does each variable take.  
2) Identify how much time does it take to run each loop/function.  
3) Creating separate .py codes that read in data and spit out variables such that your global memory is never cluttered.  
4) Read subsections of the pandas file so that memory is not an issue in the first place.  
5) Define the dtype on loading in the data into memory.  
etc..
