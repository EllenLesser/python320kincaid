# Machine learning optional exercise

I downloaded a [large dataset about the Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle to try and figure out how to work with big data in Python. This is an optional exercise because I have no idea what the correct answer might be, or any of the steps that should be taken to get there. But there's a forum on the website with lots of code discussion and snippets, so if you'd like to try out the problem we can compare our answers to those. 

Steps I'm planning on doing, which you are free to also follow (or not): 
1. Download the dataset and look at it in pandas to see possible issues (missing data etc.)
2. Split the training data into test and training sets using scikit-learn or some similar library
3. Run a naive Bayes classifier on the problem (mostly because this is the only ML classifier where I know how it works, and can therefore troubleshoot)
4. Try other machine learning classifiers to see which ones work best
