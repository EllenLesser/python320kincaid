# Machine learning optional exercise

I downloaded a [large dataset about the Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) from Kaggle to try and figure out how to work with big data in Python. This is an optional exercise because I have no idea what the correct answer might be, or any of the steps that should be taken to get there. But there's a forum on the website with lots of code discussion and snippets, so if you'd like to try out the problem we can compare our answers to those. 

Here is a [very helpful tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/ash316/eda-to-prediction-dietanic) that goes through the data and processing steps.
